# Running Splunk in a Docker Container

## Project Overview

This is the first part in a larger project that will encompass elements of Linux, containerization, security operations center (SOC) fundamentals, and data visualization. The overall goal of this project is to run a containerized instance of Splunk in a Docker container on Linux virtual machine (VM). I will then use that instance of Splunk to ingest the Boss of the SOC (BOTS) v3 dataset and complete the capture the flag (CTF). In order to advance my data visualization skills and better analyze attack trends in the dataset, I will create security dashboards in Splunk as well.

## Step 1: Linux VM

The first thing I needed to do before I could begin learning how to use Docker or Splunk, was create the VM in which my project would reside. This is also where I ran into my first problem: decision fatigue.
