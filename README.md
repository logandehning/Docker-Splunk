# Running Splunk in a Docker Container

## Project Overview

This is the first part in a larger project that will encompass elements of Linux, containerization, security operations center (SOC) fundamentals, and data visualization. The overall goal of this project is to run a containerized instance of Splunk in a Docker container on Linux virtual machine (VM). I will then use that instance of Splunk to ingest the Boss of the SOC (BOTS) v3 dataset and complete the capture the flag (CTF). In order to advance my data visualization skills and better analyze attack trends in the dataset, I will create security dashboards in Splunk as well.

### Step 1: Linux VM

The first thing I needed to do before I could begin learning how to use Docker or Splunk, was create the VM in which my project would reside. This is also where I ran into my first problem: decision fatigue. I spent far too much time considering which Linux distrobution I should use, researching the pros and cons of each. Eventually, I realized that I was succumbing to paralysis by analysis and just picked Ubuntu. Creating the VM was fairly simple. In fact, Ubuntu has a very useful [step by step guide](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview) that helps new users navigate the entire process. I already had [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) downloaded and installed, so the only thing I needed was an [image](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) for Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS. Once I had the Ubuntu image, I created my new VM and installed the OS.
